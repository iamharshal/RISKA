# RISKA

RISKA is the proposal for an open-source RISC-V based domain-specific System-on-Chip for the [Square Kilometer Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array) Science Data Processor (SKA-SDP). 

The Square Kilometer Array once built will be the world's largest radio telescope and will generate unprecedented amounts of scientific data. To process this data in near-real-time exascale performance at very low energy consumption will be required. RISKA will address these challenges via the use of integrated domain-specific accelerators.
